These are some interview questions (the ones I could remember), which I received while interviewing for DevOps roles.

- What’s a PTR in DNS?
- What’s a MX record in DNS?
- Difference between RAID 1 and 5?
- What’s the advantage of one RAID over another?
- Alternative to init.d in Linux?
- How to view running processes in Linux?
- Difference between authorization and authentication?

*Common sense: any question that could be answer by Google in 5 seconds should not be used to test any one.*
