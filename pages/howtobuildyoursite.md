## Setup [^1]Github

### Create a free account on Github.com
You do not need to use your Brookes credentials nor your Brookes email address because this web site and account is yours forever should you wish to continue using it after your course.

>Naming the account (**your username**) is important (although you can change later) because this will become part of your website URL. For example, if you name the account `MyLoveofBooks`then the web site will become `MyLovofBooks.github.io`

Please remember your username and password or keep somewhere safe.

Once you are logged in to Github, go to the following URL:

https://github.com/publisha/student_site/

> Add picture here of Template link

Use the template link to receive the repository in your own github account.

> You should now have a copy of the template web site on github

### Getting a local copy

Clone
Github Desktop
Choose a local space or even Creative Cloud (donâ€™t use google drive)
Once the clone has finished you can now open in Atom
