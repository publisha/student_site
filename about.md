From publishing software to the cloud, I started in 2001 by releasing a Linux distribution in Brazil, built 2 more products, co-founded a company, migrated to Australia, got a master’s degree, got married, became a DevOps engineer and now co-founder of SpikeNode.com.

###I <i class="fa fa-heart"></i> products

*Console Linux 1.0*, my first product release, was a Linux distribution adapted to the local market and designed to serve as material for Linux courses around the country. Many courses used my Linux as the official training material.

*NeoLinux* was a software layer over Linux that allow users to perform complicated configuration tasks using a web browser.

*Netunne* was also a software layer over Linux but more sophisticated and focused on small ISPs that need a gateway/router to control their customer’s access to the internet.

*Spikenode* is a cloud deployment tool that allows business to deploy their web applications in a completely automated way, into multiple environments (including production) while keeping total control, by using their own cloud.
