StudentBlog is a barebones starting point for responsive sites built on Jekyll and with site management in [prose](http://prose.io).

To work on the site locally, CD to the folder where this exists and run `jekyll serve --watch`, then visit `http://localhost:4000/studentblog/` in your browser.

If you notice any problems or would like to contribute to the project start a discussion from the [issues page](https://github.com/prose/starter/issues)
