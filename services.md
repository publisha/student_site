You write code. I automate your infrastructure.

Are your customers the ones that tell you when your website is malfunctioning? <br>
Does it take hours (if not days) to get a new server in production? <br>
You have a feeling that you are running more servers than you really need?

**Let me fix that for you.**

## My zero to DevOps plan

---

#### 1⋅ **Review your operations [FREE]** 

No strings attached. You tell me what you want to achieve and I'll try to help.

---

#### 2⋅ **Optimize Servers**

Once we have a deal, I'll check your servers for vulnerabilities, performance, possible bottlenecks and problems.

---

#### 3⋅ **Setup Automation** 

I will make sure your infrastructure can be regenerated with a click of a button. I use Ansible and CloudFormation (when in AWS) to achieve this.

Automation also can include setting up Continuous Integration and/or Deployments.

---

#### 4⋅ **Monitoring**

> What gets measured gets improved

Anything that can go wrong will be monitored and alerts setup, so we can start next step.

---

#### 5⋅ **On-call support**

Sometimes things go wrong. Upon alerted I will make sure your services are back as soon as possible.

## Pricing

I can guarantee that will cost less than half salary of a full-time DevOps Engineer.
